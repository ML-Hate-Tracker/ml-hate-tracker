## Welcome To The ML Tracker

We are now entering a new generation, where even speech has been modified. Our ML Tracker will allow you to search through platforms and search for specific tags, allowing the user to know the up- and- coming, and allowing the user, and organizations to tailor make their searches or buisinesses in order to keep up with the current trends.

One such implementation would be the Black Lives Matter movement, changing our history as we speek, creating a better future for the next generation. Unfortunately, people all throughout the internet, hide behind fake accounts hating on other groups without true meaning. Our tracker allows users and organizations to flag these comments, and take further action. To begin with, our Tracker will be containing a 'Hate' tag, or tracker, searthing through platforms, and returning the phrases and words said to demean others. users and organizations will then be able to take the effective measures, in order to effectively run their platforms without feeling the wrath of the media and others.
